The Btionary

My ex-girlfriend speaks an unusual patois of Cantonese Chinese and American English, accented by her own weirdness. 

I always thought I should put together a dictionary of her sayings.

One thing I could do better is tweak the entry point so that it doesn't allow duplicates.

And then I need to follow a template on what to do..
